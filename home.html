                Welcome To Freemason Tanzania
            </h1>
  
            <span class="text001">
              <p>
                Welcome to the Haven of Peace Lodge, No. 4385, Dar es Salaam, the home of Freemasonry in Tanzania, Wales, One of the oldest secular<br />
                social and charitable organisations in the world, modern Freemasonry’s roots lie in the traditions of the medieval stonemasons who<br />
                built our castles and cathedrals.
                For Freemasons, there are four important values that help define their path through life: Integrity, Friendship, Respect<br /> 
                and Service. In today’s world filled with uncertainty, these principles ring as true now as they have at any point in the<br />
                organisation’s history. Membership is open to men over 18 from all backgrounds and the organisation’s aim is to empower<br />
                members to be the best they can be – it’s about building character, supporting members as individuals and helping them make<br /> 
                a positive contribution to society. Freemasonry provides a structure for members to come together under these common goals,<br /> 
                enabling people to make new friendships, develop themselves and make valuable contributions to charitable causes. We are one <br />
                of the largest charitable givers in the country, contributing £51.1m to deserving causes in 2020.

            </h2>
            <span class="text-pkg">
                Rather than working on buildings like the masons of old, today’s Freemasons focus on<br /> 
                building themselves as people of integrity, and membership provides the structure to help <br />
                achieve that goal.
            </span>
            <h2 class="text-02">FRIENDSHIP</h2>
            <span class="text-pkg">
                One of the oldest social organisations in the world, Freemasonry is not defined by an<br /> 
                ideology. It is open to people from all religions and political persuasions and provides<br />
                the common foundation for friendships between members, many of which will last for life.
            </span>
            <h2 class="text-02">RESPECT</h2>
            <span class="text-pkg">
                With a membership of more than 150,000 people drawn from communities across the UK, Freemasonry<br />
                brings people together irrespective of their race,religion or any other perceived differences <br />
                that can divide us as a society.
            </span>
            <h2 class="text-02">SERVICE</h2>
            <span class="text-pkg">
                Whether participating in events, fundraising for a charitable cause or volunteering for public <br />
                or community organisations, service is at the very heart of Freemasonry. Our members make valuable<br />
                contributions by donating time, resources and skills.

          <span class="home-area">
              Barely a decade after the foundation of the Grand Lodge of England in 1717, Freemasonry had become<br />
              the largest and arguably the most influential of Britain's many clubs and societies. This continued<br />
              into the 20th century. A key factor was the widespread promulgation of the 1723 Constitutions of the<br />
              Freemasons, which pioneered the cutting-edge principles of the Enlightenment:
  
              <ul class="text-list">
                  <li>Religious tolerance, something wholly radical in a world characterised by religious conflict;
                  <li>Meritocracy, at a time when birth and wealth determined success;
                  <li>High standards of interpersonal civility;
                  <li>Scientific and artistic education;
                  <li>Societal and personal self-improvement.

                  Charity and Freemasons
                  Charity is in a Freemason’s DNA. It is the focus of our First Degree ceremony<br />
                   and its importance and virtues are the first lesson a newly made Freemason learns.

                     we have ceremonial traditions which encourage us both to be more tolerant and respectful<br /> 
                     and actively to fulfil our civic and charitable responsibilities; we also make time to eat,<br />
                     drink and meet together, and form lifelong friendships.

                    <span class="payment-answer">
                        Yes. Each lodge sets its own fees for new members, generally between $100 and $300. In
                        addition, members pay annual dues to support lodge<br /> operations.<br />
                    </span>

                    <span class="payment-dilector">
                        <strong>Initiation Fee:</strong> The lodge charges an initiation fee for each of the three degrees in Masonry:
                        Entered Apprentice, Fellow Craft, and Master Mason. By rule, this fee must be paid before a
                        degree can be conferred. Each lodge sets the fee for its degrees, which typically run between
                        $100 and $300. One question a man may be asked when he seeks to join the lodge is whether he
                        can afford these fees without injuring or depriving his family. If paying the fees will be a hardship,
                        he is encouraged to wait until his financial situation improves.
                    </span>
                    <span class="payment-dilector">
                        <strong>Annual Lodge Dues:</strong> Each Master Mason must pay annual dues to maintain his membership in
                        good standing. This amount is paid each year before the lodge annual meeting and election of
                        officers. Typical lodge dues average about $100 per year, depending on the activities and
                        location of the lodge. Lodges with active social and family programs or with buildings to support
                        may collect more in annual dues.<br />
                    </span>
                    <span class="member-peyment">
                        Occasionally, a member will have trouble paying his dues because of job loss, medical expenses,
                        or other financial setbacks. When this happens, the lodge will work with the member to
                        accommodate his individual situation. The goal of the lodge is to keep each Master Mason an
                        active member.<br />
