              ARE THERE COSTS TO JOIN?
            </h1>

            <span class="payment-answer">
              Yes. Each lodge sets its own fees for new members, generally between $100 and $300. In
              addition, members pay annual dues to support lodge<br /> operations.<br />
            </span>

            <span class="payment-dilector">
              <strong>Initiation Fee:</strong> The lodge charges an initiation fee for each of the three degrees in Masonry:
              Entered Apprentice, Fellow Craft, and Master Mason. By rule, this fee must be paid before a
              degree can be conferred. Each lodge sets the fee for its degrees, which typically run between
              $100 and $300. One question a man may be asked when he seeks to join the lodge is whether he
              can afford these fees without injuring or depriving his family. If paying the fees will be a hardship,
              he is encouraged to wait until his financial situation improves.
            </span>
            <span class="payment-dilector">
              <strong>Annual Lodge Dues:</strong> Each Master Mason must pay annual dues to maintain his membership in
              good standing. This amount is paid each year before the lodge annual meeting and election of
              officers. Typical lodge dues average about $100 per year, depending on the activities and
              location of the lodge. Lodges with active social and family programs or with buildings to support
              may collect more in annual dues.<br />
            </span>
            <span class="member-peyment">
              Occasionally, a member will have trouble paying his dues because of job loss, medical expenses,
              or other financial setbacks. When this happens, the lodge will work with the member to
              accommodate his individual situation. The goal of the lodge is to keep each Master Mason an
              active member.<br />
